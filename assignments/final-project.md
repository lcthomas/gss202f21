# Final Project
For your final project in this class, you will construct and reflect on your own queer archive of objects or materials that tell a history of the present. Along with your final project, you will also turn in a self-assessment in which you demonstrate that your work throughout the semester has met the requirements for the grade for which you contracted. I will update this page later in the semester with more details.
