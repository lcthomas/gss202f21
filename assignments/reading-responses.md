# Reading Responses
* **See course calendar for due dates**
* **Turn in via Blackboard**

Your reading responses will be a place for you to work out your thoughts and confusions about the course material. They are also a way to demonstrate that you are keeping up with the course reading. They will vary in length, but they will usually be quite brief (1 page or less). You will write each one in response to a prompt that I will provide, and this page will be updated throughout the semester with the prompts for each reading response. I will aim to post the prompt for each week a reading response is due by Sunday evening of that week.
