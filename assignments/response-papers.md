# Reading Responses
* **See course calendar for due dates**
* **Turn in via Blackboard: Reading Responses portal**
{: .no_toc }
Your reading responses will be a place for you to work out your thoughts and confusions about the course material. They are also a way to demonstrate that you are keeping up with the course reading. They will vary in length, but they will usually be quite brief (1 page or less). You will write each one in response to a prompt that I will provide, and this page will be updated throughout the semester with the prompts for each reading response. I will aim to post the prompt for each week a reading response is due by Sunday evening of that week.

## Response 1
1. Using at least one of the following texts we have read so far -- Somerville ("Queer"), Hall and Jagose, O'Brien, Marcus, or Stryker (so NOT the Blank reading; you will have the opportunity to discuss Blank in response 2 if you choose) -- define the term "queer theory" or "queer studies." You should describe how this text (or texts, if discussing more than one) discusses the term, but please put this definition into your own words as much as possible.
2. Using at least one additional text from the above list, describe the relationship between feminism/feminist theory and queer theory or transgender studies and queer theory. You should describe how the reading you chose discusses this relationship, but please put this explanation into your own words as much as possible. In answering this question, if it's helpful to you, you might also think about the second slide from our Tuesday, 08.24.21 class slides (the one where I listed the names of a bunch of women's studies/feminist/gender and sexuality studies programs). What do the names of these programs tell you about this relationship?

## Response 2
In this response, you will select the Blank, Somerville ("Scientific Racism and the Emergence of the Homosexual Body"), or the Cohen reading to focus on. In your response, you should do the following:

1. Indicate the author and title of your chosen piece.
2. Provide a 1-2 paragraph summary of the argument and/or main point(s) of your chosen piece, in your own words. You should try to keep direct quotations of this piece to a minimum, though you may include a few as needed.
3. Include brief discussions of 2 keywords and/or key concepts from your chosen piece. In discussing your keywords, you should include 1 quote for each keyword in which that keyword is mentioned, discussed, and/or explained. You should then explain, in your own words, what this keyword means for this piece and/or why it's important to understanding the author's argument.

## Response 3
You should respond to both of the below questions for this response:

1. What does Muñoz's concept of "disidentification" mean? You should describe how Muñoz discusses the term, but please put this definition into your own words as much as possible. (~1 paragraph)
2. Select 1 scene or segment from Marlon Rigg's *Tongues Untied* that you see as a good example, demonstration, and/or complication of disidentification and explain how or why it is a good example, demonstration, and/or complication of this concept. Please provide the timestamps of your chosen scene or segment in your response. (~1-2 paragraphs)

## Response 4
For this response, you should respond to EITHER question 1.a OR question 1.b (you only need to answer one of them). Then, you should respond to question 2.

1.a. Please rewatch the following 3 short scenes from *The Watermelon Woman* before writing your response:
* The Lee Edwards scene (~22:34-25ish)
* The scene where Cheryl shows the camera pictures of Black entertainers and film stars (~30:18-31:00)
* The closing credits scene (~1:14:44-end of the film).
The scenes above are just a few of the scenes featuring the display of “archival” materials that Cheryl (the character) has found in her research about The Watermelon Woman. In these scenes, Dunye (the director) mixes actual historical photographs and footage with fictional “historical” photographs and footage. This kind of mixing is also important to the genre of the film, as it incorporates elements of the “pseudo-documentary” style (i.e., a narrative feature film that adopts the style of a documentary; this style is related to, but distinct from, the more popular "mockumentary" style, e.g., the TV show *The Office*). As Dunye has said about the film, “The Watermelon Woman came from the real lack of any information about the lesbian and film history of African American women. Since it wasn't happening, I invented it.” What is the importance and/or effect of the film’s “invention” of history? Another way of asking this question is this: Why does this film adopt elements of the pseudo-documentary style? Why is this a (fictional) film about someone making a (documentary) film about trying to find information about a (fictional) historical figure?

 1.b. Why is Cheryl (the character) so interested in The Watermelon Woman? Is her fascination with this figure an example of identification, disidentification, and/or both? Make sure to refer to at least one specific moment or scene from the film that provides evidence of your point/explanation (make sure to provide a timestamp).

 2. Please answer all of the following questions: Who is the Editor? Who is Jack? Who is Bess? And who or what is P-------?
