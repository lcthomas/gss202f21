# Reading Responses
* **See course calendar for due dates**
* **Turn in via Blackboard: Reading Responses portal**
{: .no_toc }
Your reading responses will be a place for you to work out your thoughts and confusions about the course material. They are also a way to demonstrate that you are keeping up with the course reading. They will vary in length, but they will usually be quite brief (1 page or less). You will write each one in response to a prompt that I will provide, and this page will be updated throughout the semester with the prompts for each reading response. I will aim to post the prompt for each week a reading response is due by Sunday evening of that week.

## Response 1
1. Using at least one of the following texts we have read so far -- Somerville, Hall and Jagose, O'Brien, Marcus, or Stryker (so NOT the Blank reading; you will have the opportunity to discuss Blank in response 2 if you choose) -- define the term "queer theory" or "queer studies." You should describe how this text (or texts, if discussing more than one) discusses the term, but please put this definition into your own words as much as possible.
2. Using at least one additional text from the above list, describe the relationship between feminism/feminist theory and queer theory or transgender studies and queer theory. You should describe how the reading you chose discusses this relationship, but please put this explanation into your own words as much as possible. In answering this question, if it's helpful to you, you might also think about the second slide from our Tuesday, 08.24.21 class slides (the one where I listed the names of a bunch of women's studies/feminist/gender and sexuality studies programs). What do the names of these programs tell you about this relationship?
